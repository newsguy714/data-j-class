<p><i>Warning: Some spoilers ahead!</i></p>

<p>"Dave, I can't put my finger on it, but I sense something strange about him," Dr. Frank Poole says to Commander David Bowman aboard the <i>Discovery One</i>. They're suspicious about HAL9000, the computer overseeing the operations on their ship bound toward Jupiter. He has a core in the belly of the ship but manifests throughout as a red eye mounted on a panel, and speaks to the crew in a deep voice.</p>

<p>Hal, touted by NASA as a perfect decision-maker, is at this point struggling to rationalize government directives to keep the true purpose of this mission a secret from Bowman and Poole. That directive conflicts with Hal's general mission to be accurate and truthful, and do what's best for the crew. Slowly, Hal concludes that he can keep this secret from the crew if they are killed in action, and begins attempting to sabotage their mission, sending them out to "fix" parts of the ship which are not broken.</p>

<p>When Bowman and Poole confront Hal, accusing him of knowing something they do not, Hal says: "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know."</p>

<p>This scene follows that conversation. Given that Hal has microphones all over the ship, the two crew members get into an escape pod to avoid Hal's ears as they discuss dismantling him. But in this scene it is revealed that Hal can read lips.</p>

    [{"id":"Poole","name":"Dr. Frank Poole","description":"Poole, portrayed by Gary Lockwood, is one of the two crew members not in stasis on the <i>Discovery One</i> He and Bowman together come to a realization that Hal may be trying to endanger their lives (which is in fact the truth). Hal sends Poole out in an EVA pod to fix part of the ship, and then sabotages the endeavor, cutting off Poole's breathing and leaving him to die in the cold vacuum of space. In this scene, Poole, who had previously played chess with Hal and taken a liking to him, has come around to the idea that Hal may be too much of a threat to leave intact, and gets Bowman on board with his ideas."},
    {"id":"Hal","name":"HAL9000","description":"HAL9000 (Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer), voiced by Douglas Rain, is a supercomputer who went online in 1992 at the HAL plant in Urbana, Illinois. The most sophisticated computer at the time of the mission in <i>2001</i>, Hal is tasked with keeping all functions operational aboard the ship, including keeping it on course, controlling the engine, communicating with bases on Earth, and keeping alive a three-man crew in stasis aboard the ship. In this scene, previously sensed tension between the crew and the computer becomes dread; Hal senses that the crew knows of his plan to kill them and begins more drastic and immediate plans for their deaths."},
    {"id":"Bowman","name":"Commander David Bowman","description":"Dr. Bowman (portrayed by Keir Dullea) is the de-facto leader of the <i>Discovery</i> and a shrewd astronaut with a keen knowledge of the ship and its workings. Bowman has had several reflective conversations with Hal, as Hal expresses curiosity about the state of being. Bowman in this scene finds it tough to believe that the computer would be out to murder the two-man (living) crew, but ultimately decides that Poole's suspicions are correct. Bowman later removes Hal's memory cores, as Hal sings 'Daisy,' a song that was his first programmed 'memory' in tests at the lab in Illinois. Then Bowman goes on somewhat of a journey that would be overboard in spoilers, so I'll leave it out here."},
    {"id":"pod","name":"EVA pod","description":"The only soundproof place on the ship is inside a much smaller two-man pod, used to work on the outside of the ship or conduct small reconnaissance missions. There are three EVA (ExtraVehicular Activity) pods on the <i>Discovery</i>. Director Stanley Kubrick and science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke together came up with the idea and design for these pods, as they would be an integral part of the plot, particularly of Frank's death. In the pod, designed with the help of a former engineer on NASA's Saturn V rocket, each component has a purpose, even down to the bits of the control panels. There is full-360 view of the outside of the craft through closed-circuit TV, status reports, and more."},
    {"id":"chair","name":"Painstaking aesthetic detail","description":"While Arthur Clarke wrote the novel that paralleled the film, Kubrick spent most of his time getting involed in meticulous set design to create a good feel for the film. An important component of that was the furniture; at Space Station 5 in the beginning, Dr. Haywood Floyd sits in a 'Djinn chair,' a high-fashion piece of furniture from France that Kubrick saw as part of a 'model home of the future.' For the film, he invited several brands including IBM, Pan-Am and Whirlpool to render what the futures of their products might look like. Even the shape of these chairs in the pods was part of Kubrick's vision."}];
